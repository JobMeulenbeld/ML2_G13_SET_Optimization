# ML2_G13_SET_Optimization

This is the repository for the group project for the course Machinelearning 2. The topic of the project is optimizing Sparse Evolutionairy Training (SET). This project will cover three parts: Sparsity, SET, and Neuron importance. 
These three topics are combined with the idea of optimizing the SET algorithm. This topic seemsinteresting and relevant because of the impact it can have on large models with billions of parameters. 
The current training costs and carbon footprint of these models are ever increasing, but with a different approach we believe that these costs can be reduced.
